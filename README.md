# Tabs Rotator / Slideshow

## Overview

Tabs Rotator automatically loads URLs in new tabs and displays them as slideshows. It is useful for displaying dashboards, monitoring tools, presentations, advertisements, reports, marketing, or any other web pages that need to be cycled through regularly on a screen.

## Features

- Switch between tabs with web pages from the Internet or on your local PC using `file://` links.
- Set display time and reload interval for each URL.
- Manage configuration in the extension with import and export support.
- Load configuration from a remote URL with automatic updates. You can use a free online JSON storage (e.g. JSON Silo, n:point, Pantry).
- Automatically retries loading links if errors occur and skips failed pages until they are available again.
- It continues to work after the browser restarts and prevents tab spamming.
- Offline support. Keeps the previous page version if the page update fails.
